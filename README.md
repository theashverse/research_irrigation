#  Smart Soil Irrigation Simulation using Physics and IoT Concepts

This project simulates how water moves through soil using simple physics-based models. It also mimics IoT sensor noise to show how real smart irrigation systems might behave in practice.

The goal is to demonstrate how science and technology (Python + physics + sensors) can be used to improve water usage in agriculture.
